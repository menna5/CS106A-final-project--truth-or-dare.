# CS106A final project - truth or dare.

It's a simple program for the end of CS106A - Code in place, stanford course.

I chose a simple program that execute the known Truth or dare? game.

Truth or dare? is a mostly verbal party game requiring two or more players. Players are given the choice between answering a question truthfully, or performing a dare.
